"""This app handles the "minisite" feature."

A `minisite` is a customized subset of the main site that stands behind a
subdomain, e.g francemobilites.aides-territoires.beta.gouv.fr. It can also
be configured to respond to a completely custom domain, e.g
aides.francemobilites.fr

Each minisite needs to match a customized `SearchPage` and can be configured
with custom content and colors.
